## 1. Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing teams and developers to work on projects simultaneously. It uses **Git** as the underlying version control system and provides additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and integrations with CI/CD tools.

---

## 2. GitHub vs. Git

**Git** is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code. **GitHub** is a platform built on top of Git, offering cloud-based repositories, collaboration tools, and features such as:

- **Pull requests** for code reviews
- **Actions** for CI/CD automation
- **Issue tracking** for project management

---

## 3. Getting Started with GitHub

### 3.1 Creating a GitHub Account

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Click on **Sign up**.
3. Enter your email, password, and desired username.
4. Complete the CAPTCHA, and click **Create account**.

### 3.2 Creating a Repository

Repositories are storage spaces for your code.

1. Log into GitHub and click the **+** button at the top-right corner.
2. Click **New repository**.
3. Enter the repository name, choose between public or private, and click **Create repository**.

---

## 4. Working with GitHub

### 4.1 Cloning a Repository

To work on a project locally, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### 4.2 Adding Files to a Repository

Once files are added or modified, they need to be tracked by Git:

```bash
git add .
```

### 4.3 Committing Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

### 4.4 Pushing to a Remote Repository

Push local commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 4.5 Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository

To keep your local repository up to date:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 5. Branches and Merging

### 5.1 Creating a Branch

To work on a feature without affecting the main branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

### 5.2 Merging Branches

Once the feature is complete, merge it into the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

### 5.3 Handling Merge Conflicts

If Git cannot automatically merge changes, you'll need to resolve conflicts manually:

1. Edit conflicting files.
2. Mark conflicts as resolved:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Complete the merge:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

---

## 6. Pull Requests

Pull requests are a way to propose and discuss changes before merging.

### 6.1 Creating a Pull Request

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **New pull request**.
3. Select the branches to merge and provide a description.

### 6.2 Reviewing and Merging a Pull Request

1. Review the pull request.
2. If changes are accepted, click **Merge pull request**.

---

## 7. GitHub Actions for CI/CD

GitHub Actions automate workflows like running tests or deploying code.

### 7.1 Setting Up a Workflow

Create a file `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
```

### 7.2 Using Pre-built Actions

Leverage actions from the GitHub Marketplace by adding them to your workflow.

---

## 8. GitHub Issues and Projects

### 8.1 Creating an Issue

GitHub issues help you track bugs, feature requests, or tasks:

1. Navigate to the **Issues** tab in your repository.
2. Click **New Issue**.
3. Provide a title, description, and labels.

### 8.2 Managing Projects in GitHub

GitHub Projects allow you to organize work with Kanban-style boards:

1. Go to the **Projects** tab in your repository.
2. Click **New Project**.
3. Add issues or pull requests to the board.

---

## 9. GitHub Security Features

### 9.1 Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

To secure your GitHub account, enable 2FA:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Security**.
2. Enable **Two-factor authentication**.

### 9.2 Using Dependabot

**Dependabot** helps keep your dependencies up to date:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Enable **Dependabot alerts**.

---

## 10. Collaborating with Teams

### 10.1 Managing Collaborators

To collaborate on a project, add users to your repository:

1. Go to your repository's **Settings**.
2. Click **Collaborators**.
3. Add the GitHub usernames of collaborators.

### 10.2 Using GitHub Organizations

Organizations allow for better team collaboration:

1. Create an organization from the GitHub homepage.
2. Add repositories and manage teams within the organization.

---

## 11. GitHub CLI

The **GitHub CLI** is a command-line tool to interact with GitHub.

### 11.1 Installing GitHub CLI

Install the CLI using the package manager for your OS:

```bash
# For macOS
brew install gh

# For Linux
sudo apt install gh
```

### 11.2 Common GitHub CLI Commands

- Clone a repository:

  ```bash
  gh repo clone owner/repo
  ```

- Create a pull request:

  ```bash
  gh pr create
  ```

- View open issues:

  ```bash
  gh issue list
  ```
