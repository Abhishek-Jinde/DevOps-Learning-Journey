# Load Balancers – Comprehensive Notes with Hands-on Project

## 1. Introduction to Load Balancers
A load balancer is a network device or software that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. By evenly distributing the traffic load, a load balancer prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring system reliability and improving performance.

### Purpose in Cloud Infrastructure
Load balancers play a crucial role in modern cloud architectures, especially in distributed environments such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. They perform the following functions:
- **High Availability**: Ensures continuous service by distributing traffic only to healthy servers and automatically rerouting if a server fails.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Enhances system reliability by routing traffic to available servers when others fail.
- **Scalability**: Automatically distributes traffic across servers as more instances are added or removed in response to demand.
- **Improved User Experience**: Balances loads to prevent service degradation during traffic spikes.

### Cloud Environment Examples
- **AWS**: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB).
- **Azure**: Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4), Application Gateway (Layer 7).
- **Google Cloud**: Global Load Balancing with HTTP(S) and TCP/UDP.

## 2. Types of Load Balancers

### Layer 7 Load Balancer (Application Layer)
- **Operation**: Works at Layer 7 of the OSI model (Application Layer), inspecting the content of the HTTP/HTTPS request before deciding where to route it. Layer 7 load balancers use application-specific data, such as URL paths, HTTP headers, cookies, or query parameters, to intelligently route traffic.
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Path-Based Routing**: A Layer 7 load balancer can route requests to `/api` to one service and `/web` to another service, even if both services are running on the same backend servers.
  - **Host-Based Routing**: Can route traffic for different subdomains (e.g., `api.example.com` and `www.example.com`) to different backend pools.

- **Use Cases**: Commonly used in modern microservices architectures, API gateways, and content delivery systems where requests need to be routed to different services based on URL paths or headers.

### Layer 4 Load Balancer (Network Layer)
- **Operation**: Works at Layer 4 of the OSI model (Transport Layer) and makes routing decisions based on IP addresses and port numbers. It forwards traffic without looking into the content of the packet (i.e., TCP/UDP traffic).
  
- **Examples**:
  - **TCP/UDP Traffic**: Layer 4 load balancers route traffic for applications requiring low-latency, high-throughput connections such as VoIP, real-time gaming, and streaming services.
  - **NLB in AWS**: AWS Network Load Balancer distributes TCP/UDP traffic at very high speeds, handling millions of requests per second.

- **Use Cases**: Ideal for balancing traffic for high-throughput applications, such as load balancing for real-time data streaming, VoIP services, and databases using MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### DNS Load Balancer
- **Operation**: DNS-based load balancing uses Domain Name System (DNS) to distribute traffic across multiple servers by resolving a single domain name to multiple IP addresses. When a user queries a domain, the DNS load balancer can return different IP addresses based on factors like geographic location or load.

- **Examples**:
  - **Amazon Route 53**: AWS's DNS service that provides traffic routing based on geographic location, latency, and even failover scenarios. For example, it can direct users to the nearest server to reduce latency.
  - **Round-Robin DNS**: This method distributes traffic across multiple servers by rotating through a list of IP addresses each time the domain is resolved.

- **Use Cases**: Ideal for global traffic distribution where users from different geographical locations are routed to the nearest data center or when an application needs a simple round-robin approach to distribute the load across multiple instances.

### Classic Load Balancer (Legacy)
- **Operation**: The Classic Load Balancer (CLB) in AWS operates at both Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 7 (Application Layer). It is often used for older applications and is simpler compared to the newer ALB and NLB offerings.

- **Examples**:
  - CLB handles both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic but lacks the advanced routing features of ALB and NLB, such as host/path-based routing or WebSocket support.
  
- **Limitations**: CLB does not support modern features like WebSockets, HTTP/2, or dynamic scaling based on containerized environments like ECS and Kubernetes.

## 3. Load Balancing Algorithms

### Round Robin
- **How it works**: Requests are distributed sequentially to all backend servers in a circular order.
- **Example**: If three servers are available, the first request is sent to Server 1, the second to Server 2, and so on, with the next request being routed back to Server 1.

### Least Connections
- **How it works**: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **Example**: Ideal for applications where the load per request can vary significantly, such as database servers or long-lived HTTP connections.

### IP Hash
- **How it works**: Routes requests based on the client’s IP address, ensuring that traffic from a specific user always goes to the same server.
- **Example**: Useful for maintaining session persistence without using cookies or sticky sessions.

### Weighted Round Robin
- **How it works**: Servers are assigned weights, and traffic is distributed based on these weights. Servers with higher capacity receive more traffic.
- **Example**: If Server 1 is twice as powerful as Server 2, Server 1 might handle two-thirds of the requests, while Server 2 handles the remaining third.

## 4. Health Checks

- **Explanation**: Load balancers perform health checks to ensure that only healthy servers receive traffic. If a server fails a health check, it is automatically removed from the load balancing pool until it becomes healthy again.
  
- **Layer 4 vs. Layer 7 Health Checks**:
  - **Layer 4**: Health checks monitor network-level connectivity (i.e., whether the server responds to TCP or UDP pings).
  - **Layer 7**: Health checks examine the application itself by sending HTTP requests and verifying the response (e.g., a 200 OK status).

- **Examples**:
  - AWS ALB health checks are set to verify the `/health` endpoint of a web application. If the endpoint fails to return a 200 status code, the instance is marked unhealthy.

## 5. Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)

- **Explanation**: Session persistence (or sticky sessions) ensures that a client’s requests are consistently routed to the same backend server for the duration of a session. This is critical for applications where session data is stored locally on the server.

- **Example**:
  - In a web application using sticky sessions, once a user logs in, all of their subsequent requests are routed to the same server. This is necessary when session data is stored locally on the server instead of a centralized database or cache.

## 6. SSL/TLS Offloading

- **Explanation**: Load balancers can handle the encryption and decryption of SSL/TLS traffic, which reduces the processing load on backend servers. This process is called SSL/TLS offloading.
  
- **Example**:
  - An AWS ALB can be configured with an SSL certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), offloading the SSL termination process, so backend servers only need to process HTTP traffic.

## 7. Cross-Zone Load Balancing

- **Explanation**: Cross-zone load balancing evenly distributes traffic across servers located in different availability zones within a cloud region. This helps prevent overloading servers in a single zone and improves availability.
  
- **Example**:
  - In AWS, enabling cross-zone load balancing on an ALB allows traffic to be distributed evenly across instances in multiple availability zones.

## 8. Integration with Auto Scaling

- **Explanation**: Load balancers integrate seamlessly with Auto Scaling groups, allowing cloud infrastructure to automatically scale up or down based on traffic loads. When more instances are added to the Auto Scaling group, they are automatically added to the load balancer's target pool.
  
- **Example**:
  - In AWS, an ALB can be configured to automatically include or remove EC2 instances from its pool as they are scaled up or down by the Auto Scaling group.

## 9. Monitoring and Logging

- **Explanation**: Monitoring tools, such as **Amazon CloudWatch**, can track metrics like request count, latency, and error rates for load balancers. Logging traffic can help troubleshoot issues by providing detailed information about requests.

- **Example**:
  - CloudWatch metrics for an ALB can be used to create alarms for high latency or spikes in error rates. Access logs provide detailed information on every request, useful for debugging performance issues.

## 10. Security Best Practices

### Best Practices
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Ensure secure communication by terminating HTTPS traffic at the load balancer.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protect applications from common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Security Groups**: Configure tight security group rules for load balancers to limit traffic only from trusted sources.

- **Example**:
  - In AWS, using AWS WAF with an ALB can block requests with malicious patterns, such as SQL injection attempts.
