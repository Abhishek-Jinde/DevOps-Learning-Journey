## üìå **Introduction to AWS**

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services for computing power, storage, databases, networking, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and many more. AWS is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and flexible environment for running a variety of workloads, from small-scale personal projects to enterprise-level applications.

AWS offers a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model, allowing users to pay only for the resources they consume, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes. With its global reach, AWS enables customers to deploy their applications in multiple regions worldwide, ensuring low latency and high availability.

## üåç **AWS Global Infrastructure**

### **Regions and Availability Zones**

AWS's global infrastructure consists of **Regions, Availability Zones (AZs),** and **Edge Locations**:

1. **Regions**:
   - A **Region** is a geographically distinct area, such as "US East (N. Virginia)" or "Asia Pacific (Mumbai)." Each region contains multiple Availability Zones.
   - Regions are isolated from each other to provide maximum fault tolerance and stability.

2. **Availability Zones (AZs)**:
   - An **Availability Zone** is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. AZs are physically separate within a region, connected by low-latency, high-throughput, and redundant network links.
   - Deploying resources across multiple AZs ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

3. **Edge Locations**:
   - **Edge Locations** are data centers that cache copies of content closer to the end users. They are used by AWS services such as **CloudFront** to deliver content with low latency.
