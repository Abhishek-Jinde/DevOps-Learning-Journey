## ‚ùì **Basic AWS Concepts**

1. **What is AWS, and why is it popular?**
   - Answer: AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services such as computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, and more. It is popular due to its scalability, flexibility, global reach, security, and cost-effectiveness.

2. **Explain the key features of AWS.**
   - Answer: The key features of AWS include scalability and flexibility, security and compliance, cost management, global reach and availability, reliability, and continuous innovation.

3. **What is the pay-as-you-go pricing model in AWS?**
   - Answer: The pay-as-you-go pricing model in AWS means that customers only pay for the resources they use, without upfront costs or long-term commitments, optimizing cost efficiency.

4. **Can you name some of the core services provided by AWS?**
   - Answer: Core AWS services include Amazon EC2 (compute), Amazon S3 (storage), Amazon RDS (database), Amazon VPC (networking), and AWS IAM (security).

## üåç **AWS Global Infrastructure**

1. **What is a Region in AWS?**
   - Answer: A Region in AWS is a geographically distinct location that consists of multiple data centers, known as Availability Zones (AZs). Each region is isolated from others to ensure fault tolerance and stability.

2. **Define Availability Zones (AZs) in AWS.**
   - Answer: Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate data centers within an AWS Region that are connected by low-latency, high-throughput, and redundant network links. They provide high availability and fault tolerance.

3. **What are Edge Locations, and how are they used in AWS?**
   - Answer: Edge Locations are data centers used by AWS services like CloudFront to cache content closer to end users, providing lower latency and faster content delivery.

4. **How does AWS ensure high availability and fault tolerance using its global infrastructure?**
   - Answer: AWS ensures high availability and fault tolerance by distributing resources across multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs). Services are designed to automatically replicate data and balance load across these locations.

## üîç **AWS Services Overview**

1. **What is Amazon EC2, and how does it differ from AWS Lambda?**
   - Answer: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides resizable virtual servers to run applications. AWS Lambda, on the other hand, is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the compute resources required by the code.

2. **Explain the purpose of Amazon S3.**
   - Answer: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides scalable object storage for data backups, archiving, big data analytics, and more. It is designed for 99.999999999% durability.

3. **What is the difference between Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB?**
   - Answer: Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service designed for fast and flexible performance with a key-value and document data structure.

4. **How do AWS VPC and AWS CloudFront differ?**
   - Answer: AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) allows users to create isolated networks within the AWS cloud, while AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers content to users with low latency by caching it at Edge Locations.

## üñ•Ô∏è **AWS Management Console**

1. **What is the AWS Management Console, and why is it important?**
   - Answer: The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for managing AWS services. It allows users to configure, monitor, and manage AWS resources, providing a centralized management point for all AWS services.

2. **What are some key features of the AWS Management Console?**
   - Answer: Key features include the service navigation pane, search bar, dashboard for billing and costs, resource groups for organizing resources, and access to AWS support and documentation.

3. **How can you organize AWS resources effectively using the AWS Management Console?**
   - Answer: AWS resources can be organized effectively using **Resource Groups**, **Tags**, and **AWS Organizations**. Tags are key-value pairs that help categorize resources, while Resource Groups allow you to group resources for easier management.

## üìù **Creating an AWS Account**

1. **What are the steps to create an AWS account?**
   - Answer: Steps to create an AWS account include visiting [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com), clicking 'Create an AWS Account,' entering your email address and password, selecting an AWS support plan, providing payment information, verifying your identity, and completing the sign-up process.

2. **Why does AWS require a credit card for creating an account, even if you are using the Free Tier?**
   - Answer: AWS requires a credit card to verify the user's identity and to handle any charges that may incur if the usage exceeds the Free Tier limits or for using paid services.

3. **What is the AWS Free Tier, and how does it benefit new users?**
   - Answer: The AWS Free Tier offers free access to AWS services for 12 months to new users, allowing them to explore and use AWS resources without incurring costs, within specified usage limits.

4. **What are the different AWS support plans available, and how do they differ?**
   - Answer: AWS offers four support plans: 
   - **Basic**: Free, includes access to AWS resources and support documentation.
   - **Developer**: Paid plan, includes email support during business hours.
   - **Business**: Paid plan, provides 24/7 email, chat, and phone support.
   - **Enterprise**: Paid plan, offers 24/7 support with a dedicated Technical Account Manager.

## üöÄ **Amazon EC2**

1. **What is Amazon EC2, and what are its use cases?**
   - Answer: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is used for hosting websites, running enterprise applications, big data processing, and development environments.

2. **Describe the process of launching an EC2 instance.**
   - Answer: The process involves selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), choosing an instance type, configuring instance details, adding storage, tagging the instance, configuring security groups, reviewing settings, and finally launching the instance.

3. **What is an AMI, and how is it used in EC2?**
   - Answer: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template that contains the software configuration required to launch an EC2 instance, including the operating system, application server, and applications.

4. **What are Security Groups, and why are they important when launching an EC2 instance?**
   - Answer: Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances. They are important because they enhance the security of instances by defining allowed traffic types and sources.

5. **Explain the concept of Elastic IPs in AWS.**
   - Answer: An Elastic IP is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It is associated with an AWS account and can be mapped to any instance within a region, allowing you to mask the failure of an instance by rapidly remapping the address to another instance.

6. **What is Auto Scaling in AWS, and how does it benefit EC2 instances?**
   - Answer: Auto Scaling in AWS automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic or demand changes. It ensures that the right number of instances are running to handle the load, providing cost efficiency and high availability.

7. **How can you secure access to your EC2 instance?**
   - Answer: Access can be secured by using SSH key pairs for Linux instances, RDP for Windows instances, configuring appropriate security group rules, and using IAM roles for fine-grained access control.
