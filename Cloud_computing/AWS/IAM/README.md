## IAM Users

### What are IAM Users?

An **IAM User** in AWS represents a person or service that interacts with your AWS resources. Each user has a unique set of security credentials, allowing them to authenticate and make requests.

- **IAM Users** can have both programmatic access (via access keys) and console access (via a password).
- Each IAM User is associated with a specific AWS account.

### How to Create, Manage, and Delete IAM Users

#### AWS Management Console

1. Go to the **IAM Dashboard**.
2. Click **Users** on the left menu.
3. Click **Add User**.
4. Enter the **username** and choose access type:
   - **Programmatic access** (for API, CLI, SDK access)
   - **AWS Management Console access** (for web console access)
5. Attach a policy to grant permissions.
6. Configure optional settings such as tags.
7. Review and click **Create User**.

#### AWS CLI

```bash
# Create a new IAM user
aws iam create-user --user-name NewUserName

# Attach policy to user
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name NewUserName --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess

# Delete IAM user
aws iam delete-user --user-name NewUserName
```

### Examples of IAM Users

- Developers needing programmatic access to AWS APIs.
- System administrators managing AWS resources via the console.

### Hands-On Guide: Assigning Policies to IAM Users

1. From the **IAM Dashboard**, select **Users**.
2. Click the user you want to assign permissions to.
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab, then click **Add permissions**.
4. Choose **Attach policies** directly or add them through groups.
5. Select policies, then click **Next** and **Attach**.

### Best Practices for IAM Users

1. **Enable MFA** for all IAM users to enhance security.
2. Follow the **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only assign the permissions necessary for tasks.
3. **Rotate access keys** regularly.
4. Avoid using the **root account** for day-to-day activities.

## IAM Groups

### What are IAM Groups?

**IAM Groups** are collections of IAM users that share the same set of permissions. Instead of managing permissions individually for each user, you can assign them to a group.

- Groups do not have credentials, and users in the group inherit the group's permissions.

### How to Create, Manage, and Delete IAM Groups

#### AWS Management Console

1. Go to the **IAM Dashboard**.
2. Click **Groups** on the left menu.
3. Click **Create New Group**.
4. Enter a **group name** and click **Next Step**.
5. Attach policies to the group.
6. Review and click **Create Group**.

#### AWS CLI

```bash
# Create IAM group
aws iam create-group --group-name AdminsGroup

# Attach policy to group
aws iam attach-group-policy --group-name AdminsGroup --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess

# Delete IAM group
aws iam delete-group --group-name AdminsGroup
```

### Examples of IAM Groups

- **AdminsGroup** for administrators with full access to AWS resources.
- **DevelopersGroup** for developers needing specific access to development resources.

### Attaching Policies to IAM Groups

1. From the **IAM Dashboard**, click **Groups**.
2. Select the group to which you want to attach policies.
3. Click **Add Permissions**, select policies, and click **Attach**.

### Best Practices for IAM Groups

1. Group users based on **job function** (e.g., admins, developers).
2. Apply **policies at the group level** to simplify permission management.
3. Regularly audit group memberships and permissions.

## IAM Policies

### What are IAM Policies?

An **IAM Policy** defines permissions that specify what actions are allowed or denied for specific AWS resources. Policies are written in **JSON** format and can be attached to users, groups, or roles.

There are two main types of policies:

- **Managed Policies**: Reusable policies that can be AWS-managed or customer-managed.
- **Inline Policies**: Policies embedded directly within a user, group, or role.

### JSON Policy Structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Effect**: Either `Allow` or `Deny`.
- **Action**: Specifies the actions that are allowed/denied (e.g., `s3:ListBucket`).
- **Resource**: The AWS resource ARN affected by the policy.

### Creating, Attaching, and Managing Policies

#### AWS Management Console

1. Go to **IAM Dashboard**, click **Policies**, then **Create Policy**.
2. Choose a policy creation method: **Visual Editor** or **JSON**.
3. Define the policy (specify actions, resources, and conditions).
4. Review and click **Create Policy**.
5. Attach the policy to users or groups from the **Permissions** tab.

#### AWS CLI

```bash
# Create custom policy
aws iam create-policy --policy-name S3ReadOnly --policy-document file://policy.json

# Attach policy to a user
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name NewUserName --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/S3ReadOnly
```

### Best Practices for Policy Management

1. Apply the **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the permissions required.
2. **Use Managed Policies** for common permissions and inline policies for specific cases.
3. Regularly **audit policies** to ensure compliance and security.
4. Avoid using wildcards (`*`) in policies where possible to restrict access.

## IAM Best Practices

### Security Best Practices for IAM

1. **Enforce MFA** for all users, especially for sensitive accounts.
2. **Rotate credentials** (passwords, access keys) regularly.
3. **Use IAM Roles** for applications and services instead of users for programmatic access.
4. Always **grant least privilege**: Limit permissions to the minimum required.
5. **Monitor IAM activity** using AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config.
6. **Avoid using the root account** for day-to-day tasks.
7. Use **service-linked roles** for AWS services to manage permissions more securely.

### Implementing Best Practices in AWS

1. **Enable MFA**:
   - Console: Go to **IAM Dashboard** > **Users** > **Security credentials** > **Assign MFA device**.
   - CLI:
     ```bash
     aws iam create-virtual-mfa-device --virtual-mfa-device-name mymfa
     ```

2. **Rotate Access Keys**:
   - Regularly delete old access keys and create new ones using the **Access Keys** tab.

3. **Monitor IAM with CloudTrail**:
   - Use CloudTrail to log all IAM actions:
     - AWS Console: **CloudTrail Dashboard** > **Create Trail**.

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create and Manage IAM Users

- Create a new IAM user with programmatic access using both the AWS console and CLI.
- Assign an S3 full-access policy to the user.

### Exercise 2: Create IAM Groups and Attach Policies

- Create an IAM group called `DevelopersGroup`.
- Attach a policy that grants read-only access to EC2 and S3.

### Exercise 3: Create a Custom Policy

- Write a custom policy that allows access to a specific S3 bucket.
- Attach it to an IAM group and test the permissions.

## Interview Questions

1. **What are IAM Users, and how do they differ from IAM Roles?**
   - IAM Users are individuals or services that interact with AWS resources directly, whereas IAM Roles are intended to provide temporary access to AWS resources without needing permanent credentials.

2. **How would you enforce the principle of least privilege in IAM?**
   - By carefully assigning only the permissions necessary for users or roles to perform their tasks, and regularly auditing permissions.

3. **What is a managed policy, and how does it differ from an inline policy?**
   - Managed policies are reusable and can be attached to multiple users, groups, or roles, while inline policies are directly associated with a single entity and cannot be reused.
