# Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) 

## 1. Introduction to CIDR

**Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)** is an IP addressing method used to allocate IP addresses more efficiently and reduce the waste of IP address space. CIDR was introduced in 1993 to replace the older system known as **Classful IP addressing**, which assigned fixed blocks of IP addresses based on predefined classes (Class A, B, C, etc.).

With CIDR, you can define your own network size by specifying a **network prefix** using a notation that includes the IP address followed by a slash (`/`) and the **subnet mask length** (also known as the prefix length). This system allows for more flexible and efficient use of IP addresses.

- **Why CIDR is Important:**
  CIDR provides flexibility in how IP address spaces are allocated. It helps reduce IP address exhaustion by allowing the creation of networks of variable sizes, as opposed to the classful system where networks had fixed sizes.

- **CIDR Notation:**
  CIDR notation is written as an IP address followed by a forward slash (`/`) and the number of bits used for the network portion of the address (the prefix length). For example, `192.168.1.0/24` means that the first 24 bits are the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for hosts within that network.

  *Example:*  
  - `192.168.1.0/24` indicates a network that can contain up to 256 IP addresses, from `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255`.

## 2. CIDR Notation Explained

### 2.1 Understanding CIDR Notation
CIDR notation is a compact way to represent IP addresses and their associated network masks. The notation includes two parts:
- **IP Address:** The base IP address of the network.
- **Prefix Length (Subnet Mask):** The number of bits that represent the network portion of the address.

### 2.2 Example of CIDR Notation
In the CIDR block `192.168.1.0/24`, the **/24** means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are dedicated to the network, while the remaining 8 bits can be used for host addresses within that network.

- **CIDR Block:** `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Network Portion:** First 24 bits (`192.168.1`)
- **Host Portion:** Last 8 bits (from `0` to `255`)

  *Range of Addresses:*  
  - From `192.168.1.0` to `192.168.1.255` (with `192.168.1.0` being the network address and `192.168.1.255` as the broadcast address).

### 2.3 Prefix Length and Subnet Mask
The prefix length in CIDR notation is directly related to the subnet mask. The **subnet mask** defines which portion of the IP address is the network and which portion is available for assigning to hosts.

For example:
- **/24** (255.255.255.0): 24 bits for the network, 8 bits for hosts.
- **/16** (255.255.0.0): 16 bits for the network, 16 bits for hosts.
- **/8** (255.0.0.0): 8 bits for the network, 24 bits for hosts.

## 3. Benefits of CIDR

### 3.1 Efficient IP Address Allocation
One of the main advantages of CIDR is the efficient allocation of IP addresses. CIDR allows for the creation of networks that fit the specific size needed, rather than forcing a network to be a predefined class size.

  *Example:*  
  - If a company only needs 50 IP addresses, a CIDR block such as `192.168.1.0/26` (which provides 64 IP addresses) can be used instead of allocating a full Class C network (which provides 256 IP addresses).

### 3.2 Route Aggregation
CIDR allows for route aggregation, also known as **supernetting**, which reduces the number of routing table entries. Multiple contiguous IP address ranges can be represented by a single CIDR block, simplifying routing and improving the performance of routers.

  *Example:*  
  - Instead of having separate routes for `192.168.0.0/24`, `192.168.1.0/24`, and `192.168.2.0/24`, a single route of `192.168.0.0/22` can be used to aggregate these networks.

### 3.3 Avoiding IP Address Exhaustion
CIDR helps prevent the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses by allocating only the number of addresses needed for each network. This ensures that IP addresses are not wasted, which was a problem in the classful addressing system.

  *Example:*  
  - A small business needing only 10 IP addresses can be allocated a CIDR block like `192.168.1.0/28`, which provides 16 IP addresses, rather than wasting an entire Class C block.

---

## 4. CIDR and Subnetting

### 4.1 Subnetting with CIDR
CIDR also enables **subnetting**, which is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. Subnetting is essential for efficient IP address management within a larger network, particularly in organizations with multiple departments or locations.

  *Example:*  
  - A company might be assigned the block `192.168.0.0/16`. Using subnetting, the network can be further divided into smaller subnets like `192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.2.0/24`, and so on, to allocate IP addresses to different departments or locations.

### 4.2 Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)
CIDR allows for **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)**, which enables different subnets within the same network to have different sizes. VLSM provides greater flexibility in IP address assignment, as you can create subnets of varying sizes based on specific requirements.

  *Example:*  
  - A company might use `192.168.1.0/24` for one department needing many IP addresses and `192.168.2.0/26` for another department with fewer devices.

---

## 5. CIDR in IPv6

While CIDR was introduced to alleviate the shortage of IPv4 addresses, it also applies to **IPv6**. IPv6 addresses are much larger (128 bits compared to IPv4’s 32 bits), and CIDR is used to define network sizes in IPv6 as well.

- **IPv6 CIDR Notation:**  
  Similar to IPv4, IPv6 uses CIDR notation to define the network and host portions of an address. For example, `2001:db8::/32` represents an IPv6 network with the first 32 bits reserved for the network portion.

- **IPv6 Flexibility:**  
  Since IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space, CIDR allows for extremely granular address allocation while ensuring efficient use of address space.

  *Example:*  
  - A company might be assigned the block `2001:db8::/48`, and from this, it could create subnets like `2001:db8:1::/64` for individual networks.

---

## 6. CIDR Block Size

The size of a CIDR block is determined by its prefix length, which defines how many bits are used for the network portion of the address. The remaining bits are used for defining hosts.

- **CIDR Block Size Table:**

| CIDR Block | Subnet Mask         | Number of IP Addresses | Hosts per Subnet |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| /32        | 255.255.255.255      | 1                      | 0                |
| /30        | 255.255.255.252      | 4                      | 2                |
| /24        | 255.255.255.0        | 256                    | 254              |
| /16        | 255.255.0.0          | 65,536                 | 65,534           |
| /8         | 255.0.0.0            | 16,777,216             | 16,777,214       |

## 7. Hands-on Practical Example: Using CIDR to Allocate IP Addresses

Let’s go through an example of how CIDR is used to allocate IP addresses in a network.

### Step 1: Determine Network Requirements
Suppose a company requires three networks:
- Network 1: Requires 50 IP addresses.
- Network 2: Requires 100 IP addresses.
- Network 3: Requires 200 IP addresses.

### Step 2: Choose Appropriate CIDR Blocks
Using CIDR notation, you can allocate the required IP addresses efficiently:
- **Network 1:** Use `192.168.1.0/26` (provides 64 IP addresses).
- **Network 2:** Use `192.168.2.0/25` (provides 128 IP addresses).
- **Network 3:** Use `192.168.3.0/24` (provides 256 IP addresses).

### Step 3: Assign Addresses to Devices
Once the CIDR blocks are assigned, you can distribute IP addresses to devices within each network. For instance, for **Network 1 (192.168.1.0/26)**:
- First available IP for the gateway: `192.168.1.1`
- Devices get IPs from `192.168.1.2` to `192.168.1.62`.
- Broadcast address: `192.168.1.63`

### Step 4: Update Routing Table
Ensure that your routing table reflects the correct CIDR blocks, allowing communication between subnets if necessary.

## 6. How to Calculate CIDR

Calculating CIDR involves determining the appropriate **CIDR prefix length** (subnet mask) based on the number of IP addresses required. The prefix length represents the number of bits reserved for the network portion of the address, and the remaining bits are used for hosts.

### 6.1 Steps to Calculate CIDR

#### Step 1: Determine the Number of Hosts
First, calculate how many hosts (IP addresses) you need for your network. This includes the usable IP addresses and accounts for the network and broadcast addresses, which are reserved.

- Formula:  
  \[
  \text{Usable IPs} = 2^{(\text{Total Bits for Hosts})} - 2
  \]
  The `-2` accounts for the network and broadcast addresses.

  *Example:*  
  - If you need 50 usable IP addresses, the smallest block that can satisfy this requirement is `/26` (which provides 64 total IP addresses, of which 62 are usable).

#### Step 2: Calculate the Subnet Mask
The subnet mask defines how many bits are reserved for the network portion and how many are available for hosts.

- Formula for **number of host bits**:  
  \[
  2^n \geq \text{Number of IP addresses required}
  \]
  Where `n` is the number of bits required for hosts.

  *Example:*  
  - For 50 hosts, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 50 is `2^6 = 64`, which corresponds to `/26`.

#### Step 3: CIDR Block Size
Once the prefix length is determined, you can assign the appropriate subnet mask. The table below shows the relation between prefix length and the number of IP addresses available.

### 6.2 CIDR Block Size Table

| Prefix Length | Subnet Mask         | Total IPs | Usable IPs |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| /32           | 255.255.255.255      | 1         | 0          |
| /30           | 255.255.255.252      | 4         | 2          |
| /29           | 255.255.255.248      | 8         | 6          |
| /28           | 255.255.255.240      | 16        | 14         |
| /26           | 255.255.255.192      | 64        | 62         |
| /24           | 255.255.255.0        | 256       | 254        |
| /16           | 255.255.0.0          | 65,536    | 65,534     |
| /8            | 255.0.0.0            | 16,777,216| 16,777,214 |

  *Example:*  
  - If you need 100 IP addresses, you should use a `/25` prefix, which allows for 128 total IP addresses, of which 126 are usable.

### 6.3 Example Calculation
Let’s say you need a network with 500 usable IP addresses. Here’s how to calculate the CIDR block size:

1. **Calculate Total IPs:**  
   The closest power of 2 greater than 500 is 512 (`2^9 = 512`).

2. **Determine Prefix Length:**  
   If 9 bits are used for the host portion, the remaining 23 bits are for the network. Therefore, the CIDR block would be `/23`.

3. **CIDR Block:**  
   The CIDR block would be something like `192.168.0.0/23`, providing 512 IP addresses, of which 510 are usable.
