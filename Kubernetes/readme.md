Introduction to Kubernetes
What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Why Use Kubernetes?
High Availability: Ensure your application is always available.
Scalability: Scale your application to meet demand.
Multi-Cloud Capability: Deploy on various cloud providers or on-premises environments.
Efficient Resource Usage: Optimize resource allocation.
Key Concepts in Kubernetes
| Concept | Brief Description | |-------------|------------------------| | Pod | Smallest deployable unit, encapsulates one or more containers. | | Node | Worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster, can be a VM or physical machine. | | Cluster | Set of Nodes controlled by Kubernetes. | | Deployment| Manages rollouts and rollbacks of Pods. | | Service | Provides a network identity and load balancing for accessing Pods. |

Pods
Definition: The basic execution unit in Kubernetes, can contain one or more containers.
Characteristics:
One IP per Pod.
Shared resources (e.g., shared filesystems).
Can be managed by higher-level resources (e.g., ReplicaSet, Deployment).
Example YAML:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-first-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

ReplicaSets & ReplicationControllers
ReplicaSet:
Ensures a specified number of replica Pods are running at any given time.
Replaces ReplicationController for set-based selector.
ReplicationController (Legacy):
Ensures a specified number of replica Pods are running (equality-based selector).
Example ReplicaSet YAML:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image

kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Deployments
Definition: Manages rollouts and rollbacks of Pods and ReplicaSets.
Characteristics:
Manages the lifecycle of Pods and ReplicaSets.
Provides rollouts and rollbacks.
Can be paused and resumed during rollout.
Example Deployment YAML:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1

Services
Definition: Provides a network identity and load balancing for accessing Pods.
Types:
ClusterIP: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP (default).
NodePort: Exposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port.
LoadBalancer: Integrates with cloud providers’ load balancers.
ExternalName: Maps the Service to a DNS name.
Example Service YAML (ClusterIP):
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP

Persistent Volumes (PVs) and StatefulSets
Persistent Volumes (PVs):
Network-attached storage for Pods.
Decouples storage from Pod lifecycle.
StatefulSets:
Manages stateful applications (e.g., databases).
Provides stable network identities and persistent storage.
Example PV YAML:
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  local:
    path: /mnt/data
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - my-node

Example StatefulSet YAML:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: my-service
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi

ConfigMaps and Secrets
ConfigMaps:
API objects used to store and manage sensitive and non-sensitive data.
Decouples configuration artifacts from application code.
Secrets:
Securely store and manage sensitive information (e.g., passwords, OAuth tokens).
Encoded in Base64.
Example ConfigMap YAML:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  database: mysql
  db-host: mysql-host

Example Secret YAML:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <base64 encoded username>
  password: <base64 encoded password>

Namespaces
Definition: Logical partitioning of objects within a Kubernetes cluster.
Use Cases:
continue

Namespaces (Continued)
Use Cases:
Multi-Tenancy: Isolate applications or teams within a shared cluster.
Resource Quotas: Limit resource usage (e.g., CPU, Memory) per namespace.
Security: Apply different security policies to different namespaces.
Example Namespace YAML:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-namespace

Switching Between Namespaces (using kubectl):
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=my-namespace

Kubernetes Security
Principles:

Least Privilege Access: Grant only necessary permissions.
Network Policies: Control traffic flow between Pods.
Secret Management: Securely store sensitive data.
Key Concepts:

ServiceAccounts: Identify Pods for permission and authentication purposes.
Roles and ClusterRoles: Define permissions for resources.
RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings: Assign roles to subjects (users, service accounts).
Example Role YAML:

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: my-namespace
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

Example RoleBinding YAML:
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: my-namespace
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: my-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

Kubernetes Deployment Strategies
Types:
Recreate: Terminate the old version and deploy the new one.
Rolling Updates: Gradually replace the old version with the new one.
Blue-Green Deployments: Run two environments (e.g., blue and green) and switch between them.
Canary Releases: Roll out the new version to a subset of users before full deployment.
Example Rolling Update (in Deployment YAML):
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  ...
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1

Monitoring and Logging in Kubernetes
Monitoring Tools:

Prometheus: Metric collection and alerting.
Grafana: Visualization of metrics.
Alertmanager: Handling alerts from Prometheus.
Logging Tools:

Fluentd: Log collection and forwarding.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Log analysis and visualization.
Example Prometheus Deployment YAML:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: prometheus
        image: prometheus/prometheus:v2.24.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9090

Hands-on Exercises
Deploy a Simple Web Server:
Create a Deployment YAML for an Nginx web server.
Apply the YAML to deploy the web server.
Expose the web server via a Service.
Implement a Rolling Update:
Modify the Nginx Deployment to use a Rolling Update strategy.
Update the Nginx image version and observe the rollout.
Secure Access with RBAC:
Create a Role for reading Pods in a specific namespace.
Assign the Role to a User via a RoleBinding.
Verify the access permissions.
